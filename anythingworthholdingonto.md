Lately it seems, I've lost inspiration
It feels like its miles away
I sleep through the day and cry through the night time
I'm caught in an empty space
Takes effort to find, I don't have the strengths
I'm holding on to whats still left of me
When the life you have planned, slowly slips through your hands
When it feels like you just slept through all the best years of your life
When you can't find your way
When each day ends the same
When you have lost the fight inside of you
Is there anything worth holding on to?
It's hard to be strong, when weakness is stronger
I'm a prisioner in my own skin
I'm not good on my own, I need to be cared for
Someone to help these days begin
There are dreams I've let die, that I've just pushed aside
I need to find out, how to turn this dark back into light
When all warmth disappears, when it's been one of those years
When you are running from the truth because, your scared what you might find
When your heart is beyond repair
When you wake and no-one is there
When your home consists of only you, is there anything worth holding on to
Maybe tomorrow my heart will reawaken and I will find what I'm been searching for
But today, I'm tired and I'm running out of strength
All I know is I can't live like this anymore
When you're so far from home
When you've lost of signs of hope
When you're searching for salvation, but it feels so far away
When the words disappear and the melody is unclear
When there is nothing left
Is there anything worth holding on to
'Cause I will still be holding on
To everything worth holding on to
