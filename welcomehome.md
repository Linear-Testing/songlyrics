# Welcome Home

## Eurovision Song Contest entry in 2009

Will you take a walk with me,  
Across the island that I love,  
And I'll show you things you've never dreamed of,  
Oh my homeland of Ã‰ire is calling me home.  

I will come with you my dear,  
To the land of your birth,  
To see enchanted ruins and to see the worth,  
Of the native island that you hold dear.  


As the morning mists burns off,  
You'll see the beauty of this land,  
Through castles and valleys and vales,  
A mystical land.  

You can feel the heart of welcome,  
Beating under your feet,  
Oh the feel of friendship in the air,  
The story telling will be sweet,  
Won't you come with me now.  


We will travel the whole land. 
Where the celts came to play,  
And a thousand heartfelt welcomes,  
Will come your way. 


I'll come and see your island dear,  
Now take me home.


As the morning mists burns off,  
You'll see the beauty of this land,  
Through castles and valleys and vales,  
A mystical land.  
You can feel the heart of welcome,  
Beating under your feet,  
Oh the feel of friendship in the air,  
The story telling will be sweet,  
Won't you come with us now,  
Oh please come with us now,  
Just come with us now.
