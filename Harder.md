Stay with me
Don't hang up the phone
You listen carefully
I know it feels like you wanna leave
This world can be so lonely, yeah I been there too
Just like you
Right now everything hurts
And it's just gonna get worse, get worse
Both knees hit the cold ground
And you just wanna break down, break down
That's when you get up and you fight harder
It's just you and the dark, and a bruised broken heart
But you'll go farther
Through the fire, through the rain, through the tears, and the shame
And if you fall down, you get ups

Don't you give in, don't give up
Even if you feel like going harder
You're still here, don't forget
I'd look in the mirror wishing she could go away
Never thought that I would still be here today
I'm still fighting but I'm stronger every step I take along the way
Right now everything hurts
And it's just going to get worse, get worse
Both knees hit the cold ground
And you just wanna break down, break down
That's when you get up and you fight harder
It's just you and the dark and the bruised broken heart
But you'll go farther
Through the fire, and the rain, through the tears and the shame
And if you fall down you get up
And if you fall down you get up
Don't you give in, don't give up
Even if you feel like going harder
You're still here, don't forget
Take a breath, fight harder
Fight harder
Fight harder
Fight harder
Fight harder
Fight harder
It's just you and the dark and a bruised broken heart
But you'll go farther
Through the fire through the rain through the tears and the shame
And if you fall down you get up
And if you fall down you get up
Don't you give in, don't give up
Even if you feel like going harder
You're still here don't forget, take a breath
Fight harder
Fight harder
Fight harder
You're still here don't forget, take a breath
Fight harder
Fight even harder
